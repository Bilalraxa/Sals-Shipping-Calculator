# Sals-Shipping-Calculator
In this project, you will build a program to determine the most cost-effective way to ship a package using Sal’s Shippers. Sal’s Shippers offers three different shipping methods:

Ground Shipping: This method includes a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of the package.
Ground Shipping Premium: This option has a higher flat charge, but there is no additional charge based on the package weight.
Drone Shipping: This new option has no flat charge, but the rate based on the package weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
The program will take the weight of a package as input and calculate the cost for each shipping method. It will then compare the costs and determine the cheapest option for the user.
